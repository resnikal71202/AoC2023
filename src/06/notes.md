# Notes

- $n$ is the time to wait til the car starts driving
- $n$ also the velocity of the car
- $T_{max}$ is the maximum time the car has to drive

$$ f(x) = (T_{max} - n) * n$$

- $D_{min}$ is the minimum distance to drive

$$ D_{min} < (T_{max} - n) * n$$


$$ \frac{T_{max}}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{-4D_{min}+T_{max}^2}}{2} < n < \frac{T_{max}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{-4D_{min}+T_{max}^2}}{2} $$
